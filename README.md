Task probability OF Dr-Samir Elmogy

1- C(250, 2) = 250! / (2! * (250-2)!)
           = 250 * 249 / 2
           = 31,124
Therefore, there are 31,124 ways to choose 2 students from AI Department with a population of 250 students.

2- C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)
C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!)
         = 10
Therefore, there are 10 distinct bit strings that can be formed from three 0’s and two 1’s.

3- C(3, 3) = 1
Therefore, there is 1 bit string of length 5 that starts and ends with 1’s.

4- C(30, 3) = 30! / (3! * (30-3)!)
         = 4060
Therefore, there are 4,060 possible ways to give three awards to football team members if there are 30 players this year in this team and each one of them can receive at most only one award.

5- C(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!)
        = 20
Therefore, there are 20 ways to select 3 books from 6 distinct books.

6- P(rolling at least one 7 in three tries) = 1 - P(not rolling a 7 in three tries)
                                        = 1 - (125/216)
                                        = 91/216
Therefore, the probability that at least one of the three tries, you roll a 7 is 91/216.

7- If there are 2 books that should not both be chosen together, then we can split the problem into two cases:

One of the two books is chosen.
Neither of the two books is chosen.
For case 1, we can choose one of the two books and then choose two more books from the remaining four books. The number of ways to do this is:

C(2, 1) * C(4, 2) = 2 * 6 = 12
For case 2, we can choose three books from the four remaining books. The number of ways to do this is:

C(4, 3) = 4
Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 books from 6 Solution if there are 2 books that should not both be chosen together is:

12 + 4 = 16
Therefore, there are 16 ways to select 3 books from 6 Solution if there are 2 books that should not both be chosen together.

8- 32 * 20C9
= 32 * (20! / (9! * 11!))
= 32 * (20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12) / (9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
= 5,231,680
